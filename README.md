# Driver Drowsiness Using OpenCV

## Introduction
Drowsiness refers to sleeping abnormally sleepy. People who are drowsy may fall asleep in
inappropriate situation or at times.
Research shows that upto 25% of accidents on monotonous roads are fatigue related and
drowsiness is one of the major reasons for the increasing accidents.
On average, every 30s one person dies somewhere due to a car crash and one of the major reason
is drowsiness.
It impacts the alertness and response time of the driver but also enhances the chances of being
involved in car accidents.
Sleepy drivers fail to take right actions prior to a collision.
Aim of this project is implementing this system as a prototype by capturing live images of the
eyes.
Itâ€™s necessary to develop a system which could monitor the drowsiness of the driver.
It should alert at the critical moment when the driver is getting sleepy to prevent accidents.

# Proposed System
Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of traffic accidents. This system presents a
nonintrusive drowsiness recognition method using eye-tracking and image processing.

Robust and accurate algorithm in real time eye tracking system has been a fundamental
and challenging problem for computer vision. This system proposed a new method to
estimate eye-position and direction using python and openCV.
Represent a methodology for detection of eye blinking robustly in real time
environment.

## Conclusion
The proposed method easily detects the blinks and the drowsiness as success rate is high. System is designed
for detecting drowsiness detection for in the real time. The application is implemented in python using OpenCV library in Windows environment with a single camera view. The methods presented for video surveillance system shows promising results under good lighting conditions.
